# Framework Choice

## Frameworks Researched

### Semantic-UI

The frameworks I looked into included Semantic-UI, which I was interested in due to its reputation for being easy to use and versatile, offering many ready made themes for free that could be used as a starting point to cut down development time.

### Bootstrap

Bootstrap is the most popular framework and the one I am most familiar with which would cut down on the learning curve reducing development time, it also makes it easy to create a responsive layout and my layout varies a lot between desktop and mobile. 

### Foundation

Foundation interested me because of its use on so many popular websites and the ability to make heavily customized, good looking websites, it is considered more complex than other frameworks but would perhaps be suited to a design like mine.

### Pure

Pure is a much more lightweight framework that is designed to be styled by the developer while offering tools to make layout simple, this could be useful due to the heavily stylised nature of my design as I will likely have to do a certain amount of styling regardless of what framework I work with. 

## Framework Chosen

I have decided to develop my website with Pure for several reasons. One of Pure’s main selling points is its small footprint, touting a total size of just 3.8KB when compressed. Loading times are always important in web applications and in my situation even more so as my application is designed for natural disasters and emergencies. Users will want to be able to quickly access the application and make use of its functionality, not to mention that there is a good chance than in such emergencies internet access will not be reliable and bandwidth will need to be conserved. 

Pure does not offer as much out of the box functionality as a more meaty framework like Bootstrap but for that reason I think it is well suited to my design due to my design not necessarily being cookie cutter and requiring much configuration regardless of the framework chosen. Pure is therefore just as useful as Bootstrap to me while being far less bloated. 

Pure’s forms will be easily configured to suit my design, which is quite heavy on forms due to the nature of the application. Out of the frameworks I looked into, none of the buttons quite matched my design visually but this is another case where Pure being designed for customisation means it is well suited to my application.
